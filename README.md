# Welcome to the Where-is-your-next-job Repo!

### About the Project
[Where-is-your-next-job](https://where-is-your-next-job.herokuapp.com/index) is a 
Flask app on Heroku that predicts the job titles based on skill sets and recommends top 3 locations for job openings 
using Bureau of Labor Statistics data sourced from the [BLS Database](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series).  

Visit [Where-is-your-next-job](https://where-is-your-next-job.herokuapp.com/index) to learn more and
