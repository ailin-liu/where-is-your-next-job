# Welcome to the Predicting Survival Outcomes Repo!

### About the Project
[Predicting Survival Outcomes](http://survival-prediction.herokuapp.com/index) is a 
Flask app on Heroku that calculates the survival probability of hypothetical ICU patients 
using EHR admissions data as sourced from the [MIMIC Database](https://mimic.mit.edu/about/mimic/). 
Visit [Predicting Survival Outcomes](http://survival-prediction.herokuapp.com/index) to learn more and
give the app a try!

### About the Repo
- This repo contains some default settings in `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `runtime.txt` for running the app on Heroku.
- `templates/`, `static/`, and `models/` contain the resources to run the app.
- To run the app locally, create and activate a virtual environment (use `Python 3.6.5` and `requirements.txt`) and run: `python app.py` 

### Additional Info
- If you're interesting in creating your own model, [request access to MIMIC](https://mimic.mit.edu/gettingstarted/access/).
- If you like the template, learn more at [Start Bootstarp](https://startbootstrap.com/).
